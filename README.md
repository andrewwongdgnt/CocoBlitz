# CocoBlitz (Working name)

Based on the game [Ghost Blitz](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/83195/ghost-blitz)

A game about color recognition and reflexes for all ages. In this game, you meet five characters or objects:
- A brown giant monkey (Coco)
- A green little alligator (Chomp)
- A blue shoe
- A red pillow
- A yellow banana

Cards are revealed one at a time where each one shows pictures of two items, with one or both colored the wrong way. Try to pick the correct one! But which one?

- If one item is correctly colored, such as a brown Coco and a red Chomp, then the correct item is Coco
- Otherwise, if both items are colored incorrectly, such as a red Chomp and blue banana, then the correct item is the one not represented physically or by color among the four details shown. With the example mentioned earlier, there is a red Chomp, so the red pillow and green Chomp are both represented. Similarly, there is a blue banana, so the blue shoe and the yellow banana are also represented.  The only item not represeted is the brown Coco, so that is the correct one!
