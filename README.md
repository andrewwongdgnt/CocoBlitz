# Coco Go!

Based on the game [Ghost Blitz](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/83195/ghost-blitz)

A game about color recognition and reflexes for all ages. In this game, you meet five characters or objects:
- A brown giant monkey (Coco)
- A green little alligator (Chomp)
- A blue shoe
- A red pillow
- A yellow banana

Cards are revealed one at a time where each one shows pictures of two items, with one or both colored the wrong way. Try to pick the correct one! But which one?

- If one item is correctly colored, such as a brown Coco and a red Chomp, then the correct item is Coco
- Otherwise, if both items are colored incorrectly, such as a red Chomp and blue banana, then the correct item is the one not represented physically or by color among the four details shown. With the example mentioned earlier, there is a red Chomp, so the red pillow and green Chomp are both represented. Similarly, there is a blue banana, so the blue shoe and the yellow banana are also represented.  The only item not represeted is the brown Coco, so that is the correct one!

Kongo is super smart so he almost never gets it wrong. So what if it takes a bit longer to figure it out? If you're going to do something then you might as well do it right.
